My game involves a watermelon and the goal is to catch many slices until time runs out.
Once the user reaches 20 slices, they win.
If they fail to catch 20 slices, the lose.
They can keep track of how long it took them on the win screen.
Click enter to start, the arrow keys move the player around, and to exit press backspace.
