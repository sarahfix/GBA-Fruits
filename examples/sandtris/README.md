# Sandtris

- Author: Eric Li
- You are not expected to make something this high quality! (but if you do, it'd be very cool)

## Controls

Left, Right arrow keys for movement
Up for rotation
Down for fast drop
Enter to start
Backspace to restart

## Program

Sand-Tetris! Just like Tetris but you clear lines by connecting a row of the same color sand.

## Notes

Might skip frames at higher loads. Should never tear though.

## Disclaimer

This game actively kills braincells. I am not responsible for brainrot.
