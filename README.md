# GBA-Fruits: A Game Boy Advance Game

A fruit-themed Game Boy Advance game developed in C, where players control a watermelon to catch falling fruit slices within a time limit, showcasing embedded systems programming and game development skills.

## Overview
GBA-Fruits is a fast-paced arcade game built for the Game Boy Advance using C and a Docker-based devkitARM toolchain. The player navigates a watermelon character to collect 20 fruit slices before time runs out, with intuitive controls and a win/lose screen displaying performance metrics. This project demonstrates proficiency in low-level programming, real-time input handling, sprite management, and containerized development environments.

- **Objective**: Collect 20 fruit slices to win; failure to do so within the time limit results in a loss.
- **Technologies**: C, devkitARM, Docker, mGBA (emulator).
- **Context**: Developed as a course project for CS 2110 at Georgia Institute of Technology.

## Features
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: Control a watermelon using arrow keys to catch falling fruit slices, with collision detection and a timer system.
- **Win/Lose Conditions**: Win by collecting 20 slices; lose if time expires before reaching the goal.
- **User Interface**: Displays a win screen with the time taken to collect 20 slices or a lose screen if unsuccessful.
- **Controls**:
  - **Enter**: Start the game.
  - **Arrow Keys**: Move the watermelon left or right.
  - **Backspace**: Exit the game.
- **Sprite and Animation**: Custom fruit slice sprites with smooth animations for engaging visuals.
- **Scoring System**: Tracks collected slices and displays results on the win screen.
